The grid points within the model are chosen randomly via the rejection method with a probability distribution which the
       present function is intended to provide.

Notes:
  - The present function is interpreted by LIME as giving *relative* probabilities, the ultimate normalization being set
       by the desired number of grid points conveyed to the task via par->pIntensity.
  - If par->samplingAlgorithm is chosen to be zero (the current default value), further manipulations to the probability
       distribution are performed according to the set value of par->sampling.
  - The user may supply their own version of the present function within model.c; the default here implements the
       grid-point selection function used in LIME<=1.5.
